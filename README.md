# Manufacturing-Scheduler
A C++ implementation of a manufacturing order scheduler using priority queue data structures. The project implements both Skew Heap and Leftist Heap variants, with support for both min-heap and max-heap configurations. The scheduler helps production managers prioritize manufacturing orders based on customizable priority functions.
Key Features:

Dual implementation of Skew Heap and Leftist Heap data structures
Dynamic switching between min-heap and max-heap configurations
Customizable priority functions for order scheduling
Support for merging multiple queues
Amortized O(log n) performance for insertions and deletions

Project demonstrates:

Advanced binary tree implementations
Priority queue ADT usage
Function pointer implementation
Recursive algorithms
Memory management in C++

Built as part of CMSC 341 (Data Structures) coursework at UMBC.
